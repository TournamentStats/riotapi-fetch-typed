# riotapi-fetch-typed

Fetch the Riot Games API with type safety, thanks to the OpenAPI specification.

## Features

- Just a thin wrapper around fetch
- (Almost) Fully Type-safe
  - Regions (based on API Route)
  - API Routes
  - HTTP Methods
  - Request Body
  - Query Parameters
  - Response Body
  - Errors
- Almost instant updates with zero maintenance, Updates on the API just need a regeneration of the src/types/openapi.d.ts file using `openapi-typescript`
- supports all endpoints that are in the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/MingweiSamuel/riotapi-schema)

## Usage

### Without Error throwing

```typescript
import { createRiotFetch } from "riotapi-fetch-typed";

const riotFetch = createRiotFetch({ apiKey: process.env.RIOT_API_KEY! });

const puuid =
  "Zz2sEt4n_mfS37AyXSqXnNw4eXDHHRfsYXD2FQb7jOLIrttOjtIe88cu_fKqwkPVgCSc_4slSNSrbg";
// theoretically the route could support autofill, but current vscode typescript language doesn't support it, sadge. See below for issues
const { response, data, error } = await riotFetch(
  `/riot/account/v1/accounts/by-puuid/${puuid}`,
  {
    region: "europe", // type-safe
  }
);

if (!error) {
  const { gameName, tagLine } = data;
}
```

### With Error throwing

```typescript
const riotFetch = createRiotFetch({
  apiKey: process.env.RIOT_API_KEY!,
  throwOnResponseError: true,
});

try {
  const { response, data } = await riotFetch("/lol/tournament/v5/codes", {
    region: "europe",
    method: "post", // also type-safe
    body: {
      enoughPlayers: false,
      mapType: "SUMMONERS_RIFT",
      pickType: "TOURNAMENT_DRAFT",
      spectatorType: "ALL",
      teamSize: 5,
    }, // body is also fully typed and annotated (if exists)
  });
  const tournamentCodes = data;
} catch (e: unknown) {
  if (e instanceof RiotError) {
    console.error(e.statusCode, e.data);
  }
}
```

## Installation

Install it using your package manager:

```bash
$ npm install riot-games-fetch-typed
# or
$ pnpm install riot-games-fetch-typed
# or
$ yarn install riot-games-fetch-typed
# or
$ bun install riot-games-fetch-typed
```

## Autocomplete related issues

This library would be much more DX-friendly if typescript could autocomplete / give suggestions for template literal types. I think in theory
this could be possible, but in reality I have no clue if the typescript eco-system would allow something like that.

Issues/PRs i found that maybe relates to the autocompletion of template literals.

## How it works

This module uses the `openapi-typescript` module to generate typescript data from the Riot API OpenAPI Specification, that itself is generated from the officially documentation. Huge thanks to [Mingwei Samuel](https://github.com/MingweiSamuel) who provides them at https://github.com/MingweiSamuel/riotapi-schema. With these type information, typescript's flexible typing system including template literals and type infering, we can infer the type of response and method and applicable regions from the fetch parameters.

Feel free to contribute.

## This also exist

  - Much more feature complete, riotapi-fetch-typed is tailored for the Riot API and would require much more work to be as general as openapi-fetch
